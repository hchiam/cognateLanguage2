# "Cognate Language 2"
[Mnemonic](https://www.google.ca/search?q=mnemonic) compression for easier simultaneous multi-language [receptive vocabulary](https://www.google.ca/search?q=receptive%20vocabulary) acquisition. *Now with "order = source language",* for an added mnemonic aid. (Word length can be overcome with proper mnemonic technique [combinations](https://www.fluentin3months.com/imagination-your-key-to-memorizing-hundreds-of-words-quickly/).)

**Inspiration**: https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage (keeping separate for reference). This repo cognateLanguage2 is to be a smaller project. Since the original project already covers Chinese, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Russian, this newer project will use other, unrelated languages.

**Major difference**: A tradeoff. Don't try to compress word length (which can be overcome with proper story mnemonics using word homophones). Instead, build in consistency to make tracking source languages easier. How? Always make source languages appear in the derived words in the same order. **Example**: the derived word/mnemonic "[castahokanbi](https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage/blob/master/output_shortlist.txt#L2)" preserves the order of the source words "ca", "esta", "ho", "kana", and "bi". But in *cognateLanguage2*, **all words** should *consistently* be like this in the generated vocabulary/mnemonic list, for you to be able to make use of the order of source words.

**Pronunciation**: Same as in the original "cognateLanguage" project: all letters follow their [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) values/pronunciations, except for ["c"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Voiceless_palato-alveolar_sibilant.ogg)=/ʃ/, ["j"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Voiced_palato-alveolar_sibilant.ogg)=/ʒ/, ["y"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Palatal_approximant.ogg)=/j/, and ["h"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Voiceless_velar_fricative.ogg)=/x/.
